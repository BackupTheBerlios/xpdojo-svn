FOR FIRST RELEASE
-----------------

Continuous file testing:

- removed file.
- file removed (or emacs unsaved files saved) between source:erlang_files and later processing?
- optional location for .beam files.
- handle case when .beam files have been manually removed.
- optional report function.
- optional compile options.
- conflicts and auto(dojo)-development.
- Look why some module don't have source code %    unknown = compiling:source_of_module (prim_file),
- Avoid {error,enoent} when running test_files on weird links (unsaved emacs files).
- Avoid recompiling when changing case of directory, or introducing ../.. 
  (idea: the simplest may be to write an adlib:normalise_path/1 function, and call it at the top of
  xpdojo:test_files).
