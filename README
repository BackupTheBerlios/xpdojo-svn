WARNING:

As of April 2007, XP Dojo has moved to http://www.extremeforge.net.

The original locations:

http://www.xpdojo.net
http://developer.berlios.de/projects/xpdojo

are no longer being maintained.

The following information concerns the software as it was at the time.

XP Dojo
-------

XP Dojo is a place where extreme programmers assemble to practice
their art.

The aims of this software are:

* To provide a complete, self-contained environment fulfilling the
  needs of extreme programming teams.
* To explore some of the ideas at the forefront of extreme
  programming.
* To facilitate adoption of extreme programming in corporate
  environments, by automating or simplifying traditional needs such
  as traceability, tracking, reporting, metrics...
* To facilitate the use of extreme programming on distributed
  projects, including open source ones.

Requirements
-----------

Erlang/OTP R10B4 or above.

Installation
------------

Download the tarball, unpack to any convenient location.
Change to the ./ebin subdirectory, then
start an erlang shell in distributed mode, e.g.:

% erl -sname xpdojo

Then, from the erlang shell prompt, first compile:

1> make:all().

then run the tests to ensure that xpdojo is working on your platform:

2> xpdojo:test_files("..").

After some output (including process crashes, they are part of the
testing process), you should get a last line of output like this:

[{acceptance,39,39},{unit,101,101},{modules,27,27}]

This means that all unit and acceptance tests have passed. If the
numbers are different, some things are not working as expected.

Using
-----

You can now test any source tree of your own in the same way:

3> xpdojo:test_files("/some/path/to/source").

Or, for a more interesting experience, run the continuous testing
server:

4> testing_server:start("/some/path/to/source", fun(M) ->
io:fwrite("~p~n", [M]) end, xpdojo:default_options()).

Read src/test_files_acceptance.erl for more details (such as
defining your own rules for detecting unit and acceptance tests).
